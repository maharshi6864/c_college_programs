      In the development phase, instructional designers and developers create
      and assemble content assets blueprinted in the design phase. In this
      phase, the designers create storyboards and graphics. If e-learning is
      involved, programmers develop or integrate technologies. Testers debug
      materials and procedures. The project is reviewed and revised according to
      feedback.
