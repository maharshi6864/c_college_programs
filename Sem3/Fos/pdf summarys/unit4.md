### **1. Basic Memory Management**

**Definition**: Memory management involves efficiently allocating memory for processes to execute.

- **Types of Memory**:

  - **Real Memory (Main Memory)**: Primary storage for direct process access.
  - **Secondary Memory**: Backup storage (e.g., hard disk) used for swapping.

- **Allocation Methods**:
  - **Static Allocation**: Memory assigned before process execution.
  - **Dynamic Allocation**: Memory assigned during runtime for flexibility.

---

### **2. Logical and Physical Addresses**

- **Logical Address**: Generated by the CPU during program execution.
- **Physical Address**: The actual memory location of a process.
- **Mapping**: CPU converts logical addresses to physical addresses at runtime using the Memory Management Unit (MMU).

---

### **3. Memory Partitioning**

- **Fixed Partitioning**:

  - Divides memory into fixed-sized partitions.
  - **Issue**: Internal fragmentation occurs when processes don't fully utilize allocated partitions.

- **Variable Partitioning**:
  - Dynamically divides memory at runtime.
  - **Issue**: External fragmentation due to scattered unused memory.

---

### **4. Swapping**

**Definition**: Processes are moved between memory and secondary storage to free space for new processes.

- **Key Points**:
  - **Swap-In**: Moving a process from secondary storage into memory.
  - **Swap-Out**: Moving a process from memory to secondary storage.
- **Challenges**: Deciding which processes to swap and where to reallocate them.

---

### **5. Memory Allocation Techniques**

- **First Fit**: Allocates the first hole large enough for the process.

  - **Pro**: Simple and fast.
  - **Con**: Leads to fragmentation.

- **Best Fit**: Allocates the smallest suitable hole.

  - **Pro**: Reduces wastage.
  - **Con**: Higher search time.

- **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest available hole.
  - **Pro**: Useful in dynamic partitioning.
  - **Con**: Can leave unusable fragments.

---

### **6. Paging**

**Concept**: Divides memory into fixed-size frames and processes into pages.

- **Key Terms**:

  - **Frames**: Fixed-size blocks in physical memory.
  - **Pages**: Fixed-size blocks in logical memory.
  - **Mapping**: Logical pages are mapped to physical frames using page tables.

- **Benefit**: Eliminates external fragmentation but may cause internal fragmentation.

---

### **7. Segmentation**

**Concept**: Divides processes into variable-sized segments (e.g., code, stack, data).

- **Advantages**:

  - Matches logical divisions of the program.
  - Avoids internal fragmentation.

- **Logical Address**: Includes a segment number and an offset.

---

### **8. Virtual Memory**

**Definition**: Allows execution of processes larger than physical memory by combining paging and segmentation.

- **Demand Paging**:

  - Loads only the required pages into memory.
  - Reduces memory usage.

- **Page Fault**: Triggered when a needed page is not in memory, requiring page replacement.

---

### **9. Page Replacement Algorithms**

- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**:

  - Replaces the oldest page.
  - **Con**: May evict frequently used pages, affecting performance.

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**:
  - Replaces the page not used for the longest time.
  - **Pro**: More efficient in preserving active pages.
  - **Con**: Higher tracking overhead.
